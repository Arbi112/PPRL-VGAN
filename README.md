# PPRL-VGAN
Implementation of ["VGAN-Based Image Representation Learning for Privacy-Preserving Facial Expression Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07100.pdf).

# Prerequisites
1) Tensorflow 1.0.1 or above
2) Keras 2.0.2
3) [FERG facial expression database](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/deepexpr/ferg-db.html)
4) [MUG facial expression database](https://mug.ee.auth.gr/fed/)

# Usage
First download both datasets from the offical sources. Then, read and save the data into ".mat" or ".hdf5" files.
In our experiments, we used 85% data for training and 15% data for testing. You can decide your own training/testing ratio.
